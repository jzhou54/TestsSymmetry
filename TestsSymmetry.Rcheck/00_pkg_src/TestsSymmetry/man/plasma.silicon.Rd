\description{
A study was conducted to measure the plasma silicon level in blood within 30 women 
who have been taken a silicone implants surgery. Plasma silicon levels (microg per gram dry weight) 
were taken prior to surgical placement of the implants. A post-surgery washout period was allowed, 
and the plasma silicon levels were retaken.
